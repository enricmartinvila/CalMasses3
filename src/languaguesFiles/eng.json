    "p1": "We present SISU, the first wine of Cal Masses. Made during the 2024 harvest with grapes from old vineyards in our village: Macabeo (80%) and Sumoll (20%).",
    "p2": "Hand-harvested, destemmed and macerated with its skins for five days. Then pressed and rested for six months in stainless steel. Bottled with minimal sulfites and unfiltered to preserve authenticity.",
    "p3": "A wine that moves between colors and styles: a very special rosé, almost a 'white rosé'. Its color resembles the reddish sunsets of Pla de Bages.",
    "p4": "On the nose, notes of orange peel, ripe white fruit and a Mediterranean floral-herbaceous touch. On the palate, it is fresh and vibrant, with the acidity of Macabeo and a light astringency from Sumoll.",
    "p5": "Ideal to enjoy well chilled with light dishes: salads, pasta, rice, pizza, soft cheeses… or simply on its own or with good company.",
    "p6": "A small and honest project that speaks of resilience, identity and our landscape. A traditional Bages brisat with a modern approach: minimal intervention and maximum authenticity.",
